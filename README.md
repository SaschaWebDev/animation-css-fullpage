# animation-css-fullpage

A small example project to play around with fullpage animations with GSAP for html and css.

## Learnings

- With fullpage.JS fullpage scrolling website can be achieved easily, take care about license though
- Linear gradients for text can be easily achieved by using text transparent to punch through to a gradient background
